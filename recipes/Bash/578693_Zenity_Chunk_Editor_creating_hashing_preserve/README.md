It Open by default a uuid-like temporary file. There is no actual was to modify the name, but assuming the implementation of ZenityShellEval imply a limited acces to shell, you might recuperate information from shell or futur adding to transfer a name or simple renaming the uuid-like file-name... This is to prevent auto-execution of a script from canned-design by playing with without having all clearly create your shell script and/or having fully pseudo-code explained and having confirmation of your design work...\n\nInitially, the shell Editor look like this : is: ![Image of Zenity Shell In action](https://github.com/priendeau/Fnct.d#ZenityShellEval)\n\nThe dependency are simple, it require My GitHub Fnct.D project, available here: `[link](https://github.com/priendeau/Fnct.d)` to be installed inside /etc/init.d/Fnct.D like this \n\ngit clone https://github.com/priendeau/Fnct.d /etc/init.d/Fnct.D\n\nand loading the Lib first:\n\n. /etc/init.d/Fnct.D/fnct_lib
