This is just a simple DEMO to display a pseudo-3D effect using a bash script.\nIt generates a recessed box and a button and writes some thext inside bot.\n\nThere are two pieces of code, one for Linux, and one for OSX 10.7.5...\n\nThe Linux version also works on OSX 10.7.5 but is harder to see so a near\nidentical version using the default OSX terminal colours was craeted instead.\n\nYou will have to split the two code pieces up yourself to run...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza...
