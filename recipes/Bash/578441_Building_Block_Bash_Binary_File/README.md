Apologies for any typos, and IF this has been done before...\n\nThe code generates a 256 byte binary file of _characters_ 0x00 to 0xFF for general usage and generates another binary file manipulated in a basic way.\n\nThe for loops in the code are purely for DEMO purposes only.\n\nThis is Public Domain and you may do with it as you please. I have uploaded it elsewhere too...\n\nWatch for wordwrapping, etc and read the code for more information...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
