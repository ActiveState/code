A recent Python upload here gave me the inspiration to do a bash version...\nThis is a little tongue-in-cheek but an enjoyable bit of fun.\n\nIt took around 11 seconds to prove 90000000000 had a perfect square of 300000...\n\nIt is a stand alone program and has a degree of INPUT error correction...\n\nIt was done on a MacBook Pro, OSX 10.7.5, default bash terminal and should work on Linux flavours but it is untested...\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems...\n\nBazza...
