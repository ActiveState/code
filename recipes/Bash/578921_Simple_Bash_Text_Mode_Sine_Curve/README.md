This bash script is a taster for a kids level, audio, text mode, sweep generator.\nThe code just creates a single cycle of a quantised sine curve inside an 80 x 24 bash terminal.\nThis will be the calculator for a sinewave sweep generator from about 50Hz the 12KHz...\nThe code tells you more and the display is in comments at the end...
