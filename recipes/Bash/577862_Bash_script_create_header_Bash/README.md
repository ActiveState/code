This will create a header for a Bash script. It is a nice way keep a track of what your script does and when it was created, the author of the script, etc.. \n\nIt will open the script automatically with one of the two most popular editor out there, Vim or Emacs! It also checks to see if there is a script with the same name in the current working directory so it will not overwrite another file.\n\nv0.4: I had to kick this up a notch. I took the suggestion of "dev h" to add a chance for the user to select another name for the script.\n\nPlease leave comments and suggestions.
