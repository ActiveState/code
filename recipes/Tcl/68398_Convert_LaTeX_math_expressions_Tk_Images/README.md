This code takes a TeX or LaTeX math expression and converts it into a Tk image suitable for placing in any suitable widget.\nThis technique is ideal for complex documentation where you don't want to maintain a separate set of image files, but is not really fast enough for interactive use (unless your machine is much faster than mine.)
