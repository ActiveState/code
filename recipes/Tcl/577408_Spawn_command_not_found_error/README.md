Installed ActiveTCL and executed the commands "teacup install --force Expect".


I executed a script which will telnet to given ip.The following is the error.


The system cannot find the file specified.
    while executing
"spawn telnet $Machine".

let me know,anything missed ?

Thanks,
Siva.
