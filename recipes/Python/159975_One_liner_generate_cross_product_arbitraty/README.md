If you need to generate the cross product of a variable number of lists, here is how to do it with an obscure one-liner instead of a nice and clean recursive function. I came to this while trying to find a short and simple solution for generating the cross product of a variable number of lists. Well, it might be short, but it is obscure as well. Maybe somebody can provide me with a more elegant solution. The function works on list of lists as well.\n
