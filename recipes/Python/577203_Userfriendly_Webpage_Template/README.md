User friendly template class targeted towards Web-page usage and optimized for speed and efficiency.\n\nTags can be inserted in a template HTML file in a non-intrusive way, by using specially formatted comment strings. Therefore, the template-file can be viewed in a browser, even with prototype data embedded in it, which will later be replaced by dynamic content.\nAlso, webdesigners can continue to work on the template and upload it without further \nmodification.\n
