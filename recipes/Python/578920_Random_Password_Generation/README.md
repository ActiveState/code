Generate a password (or other secure token) using a pattern language similar to regular expressions. We'll use the `strgen` module that enables a user to generate test data, unique ids, passwords, vouchers or other randomized data very quickly using a template language. The template language is superficially similar to regular expressions but instead of defining how to match or capture strings, it defines how to generate randomized strings.\n\n\n
