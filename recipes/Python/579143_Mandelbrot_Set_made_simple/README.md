This is a mini-framework for exploring the Mandelbrot Set.\n\nIt outputs to a Tkinter window or to a PNG file (Pillow package required). It includes a disk caching mechanism for saving and later retrieving Mandelbrot calculations to avoid recalculating the Set on each run.\n\nSee module documentation for further information. Compatible with Python 2 and 3.
