A sphere is a ball, similar to a circle in three dimension, and all its surface’s points are equidistant from the centre.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the distance from the centre point to the surface is called the radius, and the equation of the sphere is : (x-a)² + (y-b)² + (z-c)²  = r² .\n\n\n\n(a,b,c) are the coordinates of the centre and r is the radius.\n
