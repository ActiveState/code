I am new to python so I need lots of help on this code\nbasically what it does is takes a decimal number(155) converts it into binary(10011011) takes the first six numbers in that(100110) converts that into a decimal number(38) and from there makes it a letter("m") according to the base64 code (http://email.about.com/cs/standards/a/base64_encoding.htm)
