A simple program to display a PDF (or XPS, EPUB, CBZ) document with forward / backward buttons and a field for directly jumping to a specific page.\nIt uses the Python binding PyMuPDF for fitz, the high-performance / high-quality graphics library of MuPDF.\nIt obviously can also be used to display XPS documents on non-Windows platforms.\n\nThis new version also supports any links contained in a page.
