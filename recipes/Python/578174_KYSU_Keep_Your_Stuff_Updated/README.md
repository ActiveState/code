I wrote this program to keep my Samba share up to date. The Samba share contains installers for the programs that I use to fix and update computers (ccleaner, mbam, java, .etc). It can also be used for ISO's such as clonezilla.\n\nFor the latest version of the script and the accompanying files please go to GitHub.\n\nhttps://github.com/Gamoholic/KYSU\n\n!!! Important! The only OS I have tested this on is Ubuntu. I will test Windows soon. If it doesn't work on any other OS please let me know! Also, I have no idea how well this works with Python 3. I may test that eventually.
