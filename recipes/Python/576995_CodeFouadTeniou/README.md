Code_Fouad_Teniou program allows you to encrypt and decrypt text by using a key ( made_key).\nHowever, the key is a set of numbers selected at random and the program allows you to create an infinity numbers of this key, which make the code impossible to crack.\nThough, I used a metaclass to access the methods used in my program to allow permutation of such methods in a way to perform desirable tasks and in a specific order to suit the  need of the programmer’s outcome. \n
