A data structure that holds a sorted collection of values, and supports efficient insertion, deletion, sorted iteration, and min/max finding.  Values may sorted either based on their natural ordering, or on a key function (specified as an argument to the search tree's constructor).  The search tree may contain duplicate values (or multiple values with equal keys) -- the ordering of such values is undefined.\n\nThis implementation was made with efficiency in mind.  In particular, it is more than twice as fast as the other native-Python implementations I tried (which all use objects to store search tree nodes).\n\nSee also: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree>, <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm>
