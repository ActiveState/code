processing.Pool (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/processing) is a nice tool to "parallelize" map() on multiple CPUs.\nHowever, imagine you have X threads which send the same request Pool.map(getNthPrimeNumber, [100000, 10000000, 10000]) at (almost) the same time. Obviously, you don't want to compute X times getNthPrimeNumber for 100000, 10000000, 10000... unless you have 3.X processors available. You would like one thread to submit the 3 requests, and then the X-1 others would notice that the requests have already been submitted and will then just wait for the result.\nThis is what this code is about: a kind of "trensient memoize" for processing.Pool::imap().
