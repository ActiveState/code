Function for flattening sequences (currently works on tuples and lists, potentially works on user-defined sequences as well, since it only explicitly disallows strings and dictionaries as sequences). [Edit]: added a "Thinking . . . " progress measurement of sorts, and a (probably inaccurate) timer.
