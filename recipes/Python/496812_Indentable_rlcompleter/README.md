A very simple module to extend the original rlcompleter module in standard library.\nAfter invoke python interpreter and import irlcompleter,\nyou can indent and also complete valid python identifiers and keywords using a single "tab" key!\n\nNote1: original python rlcompleter module only avail in unix-like environment\nNote2: if you seek a completer with history viewer support and more features you could try Sunjoong LEE's recipe at: http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/496822
