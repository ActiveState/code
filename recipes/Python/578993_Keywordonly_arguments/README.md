This is a decorator that makes some of a function's or method's arguments into keyword-only arguments.  As much as it possible, it emulates the Python 3 handling of keyword-only arguments, including messages for TypeErrors.  It's compatible with Python 3 so it can be used in code bases that support both versions.
