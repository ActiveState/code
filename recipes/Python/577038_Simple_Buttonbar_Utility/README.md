Display buttonbar generated from .ini style file of command templates.  Commandline contains path used to generate commands.  Templates can contain macros which will be replaced by parts of the file path.  Template 'copy {a} {u}\\\\{f}' could copy selected file {a} to backup directory {u} with same file name {f}.  Command line specifies name of .ini file and which sections to include in buttonbar. Not all need be used.
