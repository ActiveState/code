This program builds on work done in recipe 577632, adds new options to the context menu, and experiments with threading the GUI. Directory Pruner 2 appear to work better on Windows 7 while Directory Pruner 1 (the non-threaded version) performs better on Windows XP. Those are the primary platforms on which the two programs have been tested. Please use these applications at your own risk.\n\nIf you do not like something about this recipe and want to vote it down, please let everyone what you find fault with, how you would improve it, and an example of the code you would improve.
