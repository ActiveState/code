This script allows you to crack an MD5 hash.  The script asks you for both the file where the hash resides (a .txt file normally, although a .dat will work just as well), as well as the wordlist (also a .txt or .dat) to be used.  The program functions by hashing each line from the wordlist, and then comparing it to the hash specified.  Very quick runtime!
