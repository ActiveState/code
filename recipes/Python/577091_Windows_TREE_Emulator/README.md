Windows has a nice command line program capable of printing out a tree of the the folders, sub-folders, and possibly the files of a directory. The tool below mimics a behavioral subset of TREE, Microsoft's inspiring utility. This version is designed to output a similar tree and should be compatible on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh. In case it is not used correctly, a simple usage message will be printed (without notes on the optional "/F" switch). ASCII characters are used.
