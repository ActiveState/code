I found an article by Guido a while ago describing a generic main method for most Python programs (http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=4829).  Since then I found myself copying the same code into most of my programs.  This recipe shows how to do the same thing with a decorator that makes the code much cleaner.
