Many users get a dynamic ip address when they sign on to the internet (e.g., cable modem).  If you run a server on your home network, you probably know that you can't point a webpage address to that server with a dynamic ip b/c DNS servers need a static ip.  However, if you get a home page with your ISP (e.g., users.someisp.com/myusername), this script will allow you to automatically update your home page with a web page that will redirect your users to your dynamic ip.\n\nRun the code whenever you get a new ip address, and your users will always get to see your website.  Best part of all - YOU CONTROL YOUR SERVER!  You want to add PHP and MySQL support on your Linux server, go right ahead.  The sky's the limit :)
