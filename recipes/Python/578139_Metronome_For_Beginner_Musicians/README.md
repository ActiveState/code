This DEMO code is a simple metronome for the Linux platform. It is for newcomers to playing musical instruments as a timing unit for practicing with.\n\nIt is issued as Public Domain and you may do with it as you please...\n\nThe device /dev/dsp IS required for this to work. If your machine lacks this then install oss-compat from you distro's repository.\n\nIt exploits a flaw in the default /dev/dsp device inside linux...\n\nThe part of the code the uses Ctrl-C to exit a loop has a flaw. This is not a bug. I will let the big guns explain what is happening if they want to in the comments section.\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult pronblems...\n\nBazza, G0LCU...\n
