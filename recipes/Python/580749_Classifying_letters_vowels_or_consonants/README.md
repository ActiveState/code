This recipe shows how to take a string as input and classify the characters in it as vowels, consonants or neither. The frequency of each vowel is calculated and the frequency of all the consonants in total is calculated. The program logic is fairly simple, and uses a dictionary comprehension and a dict; the more interesting thing about it, is that it illustrates 8 Python language features in under 35 lines of code.\n\nMore details and sample output here:\n\nhttps://jugad2.blogspot.in/2017/01/classifying-letters-and-counting-their.html\n\n
