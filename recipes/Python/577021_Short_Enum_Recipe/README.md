If you want a small code snippet for enumerations in Python and the following code is sufficient for your needs, please go ahead and use it! Running the code is as simple as this: `STATE = enum('GET_QUIZ, GET_VERSE, TEACH')`\n\nThis recipe was edited and adapted after the author was inspired by seeing other, better enum recipes lying around.
