Applies python syntax highlighting to all the TextShapes (i.e. text boxes) in an OpenOffice document with the "code" graphic style applied. Typical usage is for highlighting code snippets in an Impress presentation. I have the "HighlightPython" function assigned to a menu item in my Tools menu for easy access.
