A simple script written as an experiment in geocoding addresses in a database. A list of addresses in the form of "100 Any Street, Anytown, CA, 10010" is passed to a Google Maps URL, and the latitude/longitude coordinates are extracted from the returned XML.\n\nXML methods are not used in this script, but simple string searches instead.
