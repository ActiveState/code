Polynomial explorer. You tell this module what order of polynomial you want and it will set up a figure with a graph of that polynomial plotted with x = -1 to +1. It will set up a second figure with a set of coefficient axes. You can click on the coeffiecient axes to set the coefficents. The graph will then update to reflect the values of the new coefficients.\n\nThis code illustrates the use of mouse interaction using matplotlib
