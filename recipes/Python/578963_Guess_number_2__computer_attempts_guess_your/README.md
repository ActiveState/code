Guess a number was part 1 was Human trying to guess a random number between 1 and 100 in 10 tries. This time the computer is trying to guess. Simple program for beginner to learn very simple formula as a start to an algorithm for AI. And conditional choice. The program is not perfect, as it will not force a victory when the computer guessed right, neither it can control if you cheated or not. But this is not the goal here.
