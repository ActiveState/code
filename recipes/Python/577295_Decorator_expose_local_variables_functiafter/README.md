Please note that the present is a fork of the recipe 577283 "Decorator to expose local variables of a function after execution" of Pietro Berkes, available at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577283-decorator-to-expose-local-variables-of-a-function-/ , and aiming only to report the alternative implementation "persistent_locals2", whose I'm co-author with Pietro Berkes, and which was submitted together to the original recipe. Refer to the latter for an exhaustive description and discussion.
