An example of how to make an entry widget with autocompletion for the Tkinter GUI. It uses regular expression but you can subclass AutocompleteEntry and override the comparison method.\n\nYou can use the arrow keys 'up' and 'down' to select an item at the listbox, and the 'right' key to take it to the entry widget.
