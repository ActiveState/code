Part of a tutorial of programming Load Runner in Python, this code shows the evolution to creating a simple game in the language that should be able to run on Windows. The original code was supposed to run on Linux, but this recipe takes the idea in another direction and shows that programs can be created incrementally. Please note the various file divisions: `load1`, `load2`, `load3`, `load4`, `load5`, and `Extended Demo (Sound)`.
