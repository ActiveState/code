The "CookieInfo" and "Cookie" classes provide developers with an read-only interface to the "cookies.txt" that most browsers store. The CookieInfo class makes Cookie objects from the cookie file. It also provides methods to operate on the whole set of Cookies. The Cookie object provides methods to convert a cookie into both XML and SQL.
