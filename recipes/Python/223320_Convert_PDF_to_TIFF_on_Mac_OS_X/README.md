This is a very short code snippet illustrating how to convert individual pages of PDF documents to TIFF files, one TIFF file per page. It works only on Mac OS X with PyObjC installed. As a recipe the code is compact and does not check for many error conditions, etc. The more extended version does so and can also be used as a command-line tool.
