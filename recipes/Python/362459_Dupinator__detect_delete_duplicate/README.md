Point this script at a folder or several folders and it will find and delete all duplicate files within the folders, leaving behind the first file found of any set of duplicates.   It is designed to handle hundreds of thousands of files of any size at a time and to do so quickly.   It was written to eliminate duplicates across several photo libraries that had been shared between users.  As the script was a one-off to solve a very particular problem, there are no options nor is it refactoring into any kind of modules or reusable functions.
