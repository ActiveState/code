The Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) problem is an NP-hard problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_common_supersequence), which occurs in problems originating from various domains, e.g. Bio Genetics. Given a set of strings, the common supersequence of minimal length is sought after. Below a set of algorithms is given, which I used in approximating and/or backtracking the optimal solution(s).
