This is a simple GUI program that shows Markov Encryption at work. It is built to be interactive and has all needed code embedded within itself. This version of ME library is not very efficient and represents an early attempt at developing and easily testing the code. Certain limits are built into the program, and the code is not meant to be robust at this stage. This program is a proof-of-concept design meant to ensure that the work being done was viable for future use and that the encryption process could be carried out both ways, both in encoding plaintext and decoding ciphertext.
