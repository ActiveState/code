A framework for easy (2-way) inter-thread communication resembling normal function calling.\n\nEspecially useful for non-blocking UI techniques and for load distribution on jerky resources. Can replace stiff Queue.Queue techniques in most cases - making threading code more readable and functional.\n\nCallQueue lets you express function directly in local context, but execute things in a target thread. It focuses naturally on 2-way communication (with return value responses) and includes a fluid concept for inter-thread exception (transfer) issues. Supports also multi-producer, multi-consumer communication.\n\nA target thread just has to do callqueue.receive() periodically without worrying about any data passing. Thus CallQueue also supports naturally a high-level bulk threading concept with anonymous "default consumer threads": Allocated "thread resources" can be thrown efficently on bunches of jobs.
