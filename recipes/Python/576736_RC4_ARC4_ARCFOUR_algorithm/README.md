RC4 generates a pseudorandom stream of bits (a keystream) which, for encryption, is combined with the plaintext using bit-wise exclusive-or; decryption is performed the same way (since exclusive-or is a symmetric operation).\n\n(see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4))
