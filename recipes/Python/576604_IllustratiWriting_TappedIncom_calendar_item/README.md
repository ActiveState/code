This recipe is for reference purposes. It indicates how the FeedDemon RSS reader supplies information about a post to a blog publisher application under the default arrangements (ie, without specifying XML), and then how this information can be reformatted for a TappedIn.com calendar item for submission to the Google Calendar. Nothing unusual but might be useful to people who use FeedDemon and want to record TappedIn sessions on Google (obviously).
