EDITED:\nA small animated graphics demo in Tkinter, displaying a 1990's style Rotozoom, more interesting than the TV snow I posted previously. The Tkinter management part is just the same. The code is a little longer as some trig tables must be precalculated for speed. The window size corresponds to the resolution of the old DOS screen 13, as I originally coded the demo for Qbasic.
