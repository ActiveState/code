This module was written for self-academic purposes in an attempt to understand databases better. Just as in college where students are required to reinvent "wheels" like linked lists, trees, binary searches, et cetera, developing this program helped me understand some of the things that goes on behind the scenes in a database while also helping to learn what the desired output of each operation should be. The code in this module provides support for running a simple database engine that runs completely in memory and allows usage of various concepts available in a structured query language to get and set data that may be saved to file.
