Reads creation date from EXIF picture/video file header, and sets it to the file's creation and modification dates. This script differs from other recipes in its ability to work with the creation date in Windows.\nThe script depends on several libraries: Win32 Extensions, pyexif, exif. [Here's](http://koblik.blogspot.com/2009/06/exif-with-python.html) description of what they do and where to get them.
