This is an evolutionary algorithm that returns a random list of prime numbers. This code is highly inefficient for a reason. This algorithm is more of a proof of concept that if a prime was a heritable trait, it would not be a desired one. \n\nParameters:\n\nisPrime --> n: number to check if it is prime\nallPrimes --> n: size of list of random primes, m: the primes in the list will be between 0 and m
