Provides a `_paths_from_path_patterns` that will generate a list of paths from a list of path patterns. A "path pattern" can include glob chars. By default it generates a recursive listing of file paths, but: recursion can be turned off, file and/or dir paths can be listed. It supports a list of glob exclusions or inclusions.\n\nThis function makes it easy to implement typical "-r|--recursive" and "-x|--exclude" options for command-line scripts that work on given file paths. See [example usages below](#block-1).\n\nNote: I use a leading `_` on function names because my typical usage of my recipes is as re-usable *internal* functions in Python modules.\n\n
