This module provides a powerful 'switch'-like dispatcher system, using decorators to give a syntax somewhat like that of the switch statement in C.  Values for switch cases can be anything comparable via '==', a string for use on the left-hand side of the 'in' operator, or a regular expression.\nIterables of these types can also be used.\n
