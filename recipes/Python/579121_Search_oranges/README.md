The wikipedia Python library (available on PyPI) is a wrapper for the official Wikipedia API. The library is higher level and easier to use than the API, though for limited functionality of the API. It can be used to easily do basic access of Wikipedia pages, which could be useful for many educational, reference and other purposes. This recipe shows the basic use of the wikipedia library, by using it to search for information about oranges.\n
