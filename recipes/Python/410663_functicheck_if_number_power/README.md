primepow(aNumber) finds the prime number P and power N of aNumber such that aNumber = P^N.\n\nThe implementation is heavily borrowed from Art Owen <a href="http://www.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/cpp_src/oa/oa.html">Orthogonal Arrays Library</a>. It requires the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/410662">isprime()</a> function.
