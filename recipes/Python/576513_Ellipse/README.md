In early 1600 Johannas Kepler conclude that all the planets in the solar system move in elliptical orbits with the sun at a focus, thus, the importance of ellipse in science.\nEllipse is a Python program for students and tutors at higher levels of education .\nThere are two equations of an ellipse : x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 and: x^2/b^2 + y^2/a^2  the foci are on the x axis or y axis.\nFrom Ellipse program the student will be able to sketch the ellipse, by drawing a box with (a) and (-a) units on the major axis and ( b) and (-b) units on the minor axis. \nSince Ellipse program determine the values of a and b and the position of the foci c.\nc = Square-Root (a^2 – b^2)\n
