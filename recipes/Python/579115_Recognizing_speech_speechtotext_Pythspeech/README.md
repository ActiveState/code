This recipe shows how to use the 'speech' (or 'pyspeech' - it seems to have two names) Python library to make the computer recognize what you say and convert it to text. Note: This library did not always give correct results for me, so it may not be advisable to use it in production. Also, the pyspeech site says that the library is no longer being maintained. Use at your own risk.
