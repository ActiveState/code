***Is it possible to create a simple command line program that I can use to quickly test my regular expressions?***\n\nYes it is. This simple regular expression tester uses Python's re module as well as others to quickly allow you to test your regular expression in one go.\n\nTODO:\n\n* Add Support For Multiple Regular Expression Input\n\nRecent Changes:\n\n* Made the output prettier with a little more whitespace.
