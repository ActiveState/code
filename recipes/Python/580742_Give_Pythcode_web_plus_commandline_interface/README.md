This recipe shows how to take a Python function and wrap it with both a web and a command-line interface, somewhat easily, using the hug Python library. The example used shows how to wrap a function that uses the psutil library to get information on disk partitions. So you can see the disk partition info either via the web browser or the command line. The code for the recipe is shown below. It is also possible to wrap multiple functions in the same Python file, and expose all of them via both the web and the command-line.\n\nMore information and multiple sample outputs are available here:\n\nhttps://jugad2.blogspot.in/2017/01/give-your-python-function-webcli-hug.html\n\n
