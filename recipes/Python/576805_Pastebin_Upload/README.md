A little script I made for some buddies and I. We are constantly collaborating on code. This scrips takes a source code file as it's parameter and uploads it to pastebin.com or any sub domain of pastebin.\nI integrated it with the righ click window in windows. Without that integration the script wouldn't be as cool!\nHope others find it useful.
