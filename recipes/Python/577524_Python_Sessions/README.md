I think this script should now be functional enough to post here at ActiveState. When you reply or vote down, please post some information on your problem with the code, and if you can, maybe something about the solution. This interface works, and is designed especially for Python. If you like it, don't be afraid to post that either, constructive criticism is all good, but compliments are even better! ;)\n\nGet the latest version of this code here:\nhttp://wiki.sunjay.ca/Python:Contents/Python_Session\n\n**Latest Changes:**\n\n* Added a new function for making the session cookie last longer. See code for `set_expires`. Note: This new function is just in case you need to include a session for longer than one brower session (for example, one day instead).
