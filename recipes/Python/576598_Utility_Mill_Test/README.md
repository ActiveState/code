After recently discovering the Utility Mill, I decided to create an automated tester that would check that the latest revision was still operating according to specifications. It checks the web site once a minute and displays status information as it runs. It is included here because it comes in three sections. The first section has several utility functions that you may find useful in your own applications. The actual test suite is located in the second section. The last section includes code that makes getting random text easy and fast (after an initial loading session). Hopefully, the first portion of the code may be of use to you.
