Various sources (but principally Hammond and Robinson) show how to instantiate Internet Explorer in order to have access to its interfaces. However, few places show how to connect to an instance that is already running, which is so easy in VB.\n\nThanks are due to someone called "gcash" for this idea. See http://dbforums.com/t867088.html.\n\nIt just seemed to me that this is a good recipe to have in this collection as a reference to a certain approach, rather than as a full solution.
