This recipe is a simple (very simple) batch process dispatcher. It allows you to utilize a simple file with a list of commands to run to make your command-line life a little easier. I use it for mencoder so I don't have to type/paste in a bunch of commands for backing up my DVDs. I can just write a batch file. And if there is an error somewhere along the way, or I need to stop for some reason, I can just start where I left off when I am ready.
