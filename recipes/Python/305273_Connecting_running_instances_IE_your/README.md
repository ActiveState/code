This sample connects to the running instances of IE on your computer and prints out the URL, Cookie- if any, and the HTML content of the site.\nIt can be extended to connect to running instances on another computer using DCOM and particularly using CoCreateInstanceEx():\nExtend it as you wish and let me know how useful it has been to you!
