I was looking for a simple way to generate HTML directly in python that does not require learning a new template 'language' nor requires the installation of a big complex package. Closest thing I found was James Casbon's attempt(https://gist.github.com/1461441). This is my version of the same idea. \n\n(2013-04-21) added some simplifications and support for switching off string interpolation.
