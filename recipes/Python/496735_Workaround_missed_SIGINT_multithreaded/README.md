Multithreaded Python programs often ignore the SIGINT generated by a\nKeyboard Interrupt, especially if the thread that gets the signal is\nwaiting or sleeping.  This module provides a workaround by forking a\nchild process that executes the rest of the program while the parent\nprocess waits for signals and kills the child process.
