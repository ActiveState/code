2-D Matrix operations without the use of numpy module
------------------------------------------------------------------

In situations where numpy module isn't available, you can use these functions to calculate the inverse, determinant, transpose of matrix, calculate the minors of it's elements, and multiply two matrices together.
Any advice to make these functions better will be appreciated.
