For those of you who have not found a Bible reading schedule or are not satisfied with what you have and want a change, the following recipe is provided as the result of a programming project today for the New Year. Begin with the first reference and read up to but not including the next reference. Continue from day to day, and you will find that by the end of the year, the entire Bible has been read with equally spaced portions of reading and time. The schedule was developed with the intention to read about the same number of words per day. The Bible used was "bible13.txt" (King James Version) from Project Gutenberg.
