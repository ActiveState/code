Related to recipe 577108 and recipe 577110, this library of functions was written for those that wish to explore more in experimental programming in the Whitespace language (and more specifically, assembly derived from the language). The code is divided into several sections, starting with an explanation of some special memory locations and a list of functions available grouped by their general purpose. Next comes a table of errors that could raised while the code is running and the body of the main test function for the entire program. The next three sections (in order) are three untested functions, the functions intended for usage, and individual test functions for the preceding code. Most of the documentation is written in modified Python to express how all of the code operates.\n\nIf you have any comments or wish to vote this recipe down, please provide an explanation as to what you find fault with in this program and also a solution that you would implement to fix the problem.
