With the introduction of Python 3.0 comes incompatibility issues. This recipe introduces that helpful utility "md5sum" compatible with the new release. It was written from scratch with version 3.0 in mind and attempts to be simple, readable, and useful to those people who need a cross-platform utility that can calculate checksums via Python. There is no documentation, but the program should be easy to understand for anyone who knows even a little about one of our favorite languages.
