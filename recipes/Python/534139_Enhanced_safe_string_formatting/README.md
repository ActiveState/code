Ever found "str" % (a,b) a bit limited?\nDo you want to supply some arguments now, and fill the rest in later?\nOr mix positional and named arguments, i.e. supply a tuple and a dict?\nDo you want to put string templates in a configuration file to be read with ConfigParser?\nI hope you like this recipe.
