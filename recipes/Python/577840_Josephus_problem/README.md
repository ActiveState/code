In computer science and mathematics, the Josephus problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game.\n\nThere are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. After the first person is executed, certain number of people are skipped and one person is executed. Then again, people are skipped and a person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.\n\nThe task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so survive.\nIf 2 are the number of people that are skipped
