This module provides classes that are useful for executing Markov encryption and decryption on data. ME was inspired by a combination of Markov chains with the puzzles of Sudoku. This implementation is a rewrite from the Python 3.x version and includes various changes and optimizations to work with Python 2.5 and related versions. All documentation has been left in recipe 578075 and should be referred to there.
