The most commonly used number system is the denary number system, a system of numbers to base 10. However, All the others numbers systems are used in the computing field.\nAnd the binary number system, a system of numbers to base 2 uses only two digits 0 and 1, and any position in a binary number system increases by powers of 2 in contrast with the decimal system, which increases by powers of 10.\n**Though, the binary number system was invented by a Chinese poet and philosopher Shao Yong in the 11th century.**\nSolving repetitive problems requires a powerful method and yet recursion allows the design of faster recursive algorithms. Recursion method could be used to solve higher-level mathematics problems, such as sequences and it is a branch in computer science study.
