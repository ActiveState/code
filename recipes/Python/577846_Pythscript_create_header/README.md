This will create a header for a Python script. It is a nice way keep a track of what your script does and when it was created, the author of the script, etc.. \n\nUpdate: Now, it will automatically open with one of the two most popular editors, Vim or Emacs! This script has been updated from the second version to replace spaces with underscores in the title, to convert uppercase to lowercase. It also checks to see if there is a script with the same name in the current working directory so it will not overwrite another file. Please leave comments and suggestions.\n\n
