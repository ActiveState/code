Python implementation of an adaptive replacement cache, as described in:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Replacement_Cache\n\nCaveat: This may or may not be under patent by IBM, beware of putting it in production code. I implemented it as an experiment, and since I'm in Europe I do not believe a software patent can apply to anything I write.
