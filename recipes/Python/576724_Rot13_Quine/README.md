A Quine is a program that, when run, prints its own source code (without resorting to easy solutions like reading its code from the filesystem). The rot13 encoding maps every letter 13 places forwards in the alphabet (wrapping around the end and preserving case). Just for fun, I wrote a quine in the rot13 encoding.
