This is a template method for the hill climbing algorithm. It doesn't guarantee that it will return the optimal solution. If the probability of success for a given initial random configuration is p the number of repetitions of the Hill Climbing algorithm should be at least 1/p.\nNote: generate_configuration() is not implemented yet but is quite easy to understand what it does.
