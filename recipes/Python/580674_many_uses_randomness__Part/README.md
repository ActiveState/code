This recipe shows some of the many uses of random numbers, using the random function from the random module from Python's standard library. A subsequent recipe or two will show other uses, both of other functions from the module, and for other purposes.\n\nThe uses shown in this recipe have to do with using random float values, and scaling them and offsetting them, and also how to get a repeated/predictable series of random numbers.\n
