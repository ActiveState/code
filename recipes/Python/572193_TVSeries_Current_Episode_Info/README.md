The getEps function in this module returns a text string containing the original air date for the last aired and next upcoming episodes of a TV series title. It also provides the plot for the next upcoming episode, if available. The information returned is limited to what is available at IMDb, and so it may not be up to date. IMDbPY (http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/) is used. See code for usage information and examples.
