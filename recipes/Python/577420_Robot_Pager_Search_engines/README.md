This is a class to make easy the development of robots, to parse results over a website with a paging. For example Google, Yahoo, Bing, or any other page with paging system.\n\nPagerEngine is the main class. I've developed three more clases implementing GoogleSearch, YahooSearch and BingSearch as examples.\n\nInheriting from PagerEngine (and having RexExp knowledge) you can easily develop other robots for other websites.
