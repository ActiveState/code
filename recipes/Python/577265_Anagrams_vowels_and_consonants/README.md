An anagram could be a word, or a sentence, of which the letters could be rearranged to form a different word, or a different sentence.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, vowels and consonants could be combined to form a syllable.\n\n\n\n\nThough, counting the numbers of vowels and consonants forming a word or a phrase, is a writing technique to enhance the writing style, and balance the phonetic. \n\n\n\n\nMy program Anagrams, vowels, and consonants, allows you to compute the numbers of vowels, and consonants forming a word, a sentence, or a full text, and rearrange the letters forming every word within a text in every possible combination, thus, finding anagrams for each word within the sentence.
