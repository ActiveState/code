This is a revamp of a recipe that Ned Batchelder [posted on his blog](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200804/the_structure_of_pyc_files.html) a few years ago (thanks Ned!).  That page is pretty insightful, recipe aside.\n\nThis recipe works for all versions of Python back to 2.4 (at least).  Warning: using one version of Python to inspect a pyc file from another Python version may not work too well.
