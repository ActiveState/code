\nThis recipe shows how to convert numeric strings into integers, i.e. it emulates the Python int() function - partially. It does not handle negative numbers, floating point numbers, or numbers in other bases than decimal. It is only meant as a simple demo of the steps by which a string containing an integer value, is converted into an actual integer, in Python (and similarly, in other languages).\n
