This is my own version of combobox autocomplete. The user can customize the matching function setting whether he wants to ignore case or whether the matching function should only match from the beginning of the string. The other possibility is to provide your own "auto complete function". The complete function returns all the found strings matching the text in the entry box.\n\nIt's also possible to customize the height of listbox and whether to use horizontal or vertical scrollbars.\n\nUse arrows or Contro+n, Control+p to move selection on listbox.\n\nThis is a practical application of the combobox widget:\n\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/580771-tkinter-file-autocomplete-entry/
