And here is my second interpretation of the card game known as "WAR." If you are wondering how it works, you should look at "Version 1" of this program (it is another program that I submitted). There is no documentation whatsoever of this program (as you can see), but it follows just about the same logic of the first game. This game is just easier to win at IMHO.
