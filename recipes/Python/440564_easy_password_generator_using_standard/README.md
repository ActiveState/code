This recipe generates a password of any length using the standard library modules of Python. The password generated is a function of an identifier and a master password.\n\nI liked the idea behind the PasswordMaker browser plugin (http://passwordmaker.org/). But I wanted to have a portable command line version which I wanted to carry around without having the need to install an application or needing a web browser. Additionally I wanted to use only the pre-installed modules.\nI haven't looked into the PasswordMaker's algorithms but I have borrowed the main idea that you have a single master password. To that you add a site address or your account name and take a cryptographic hash (MD5, SHA-1, etc.) of this string. Your password will be a function of this generated hash.\nI have broken each of the above steps into separate functions so that one can replace the actual implementation with their own algorithms.\nNote on Security: I am not a security expert; so I am not qualified to comment on how secure this approach is. I welcome others' comments on the vulnerabilities.
