Really short snipped of a decimal and binary prefix calculator in Python.\n\nWithout covering the entire International System of Units (SI) range, it does fit my daily needs.  \nThe code could be *way* smarter, but i wanted to keep the recipe as basic as i could.\n\nTested on `Python 2.4.1` and `2.6.4;` could work on lower as well.
