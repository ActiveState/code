Having written many programs that work with groups of files, the zero programs were written based on a simple batch engine in the `zero` utility. All of the other programs import the first program to take advantage of its batch processor while supplementing there own functionality in place of zeroing out file data. This is committed for archival to be run under Python 2.5 or later versions.
