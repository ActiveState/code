I have four cubes (in real) with different colors on their sides as a puzzle with the final goal to place each cube side by side that way that on each visible side (except the two ends) you can see four different colors.\n\nI have placed the cubes as they are (side by side) writing down the current colors (see function main). The CubesChecker class is searching for one solution. You don't see the operation on how to rotate but knowing the final state it's really easy to do it yourself then.
