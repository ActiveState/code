The precise rate of IRR( Internal Rate of Return ) is found using my program IRR-Versus-NPV, where I used the linear interpolation .\nHowever, companies decide to take or reject a project by comparing the IRR value to the minimum required return. If the IRR is greater than the cost of capital the project should go ahead, otherwise the project should be rejected.\nThe NPV (Net Present Value) could also be computed using my program, where projects are accepted or rejected on the basis of the NPV value, if the NPV is greater than zero the project is accepted , otherwise rejected, a positive NPV demonstrate the project is attractive, thus, it will increase the shareholders’ wealth by this amount.\nNPV and IRR are both superior Project appraisal techniques, yet the NPV method is a better technique, since it shows an exact amount of increase in shareholders’ wealth, and yet the IRR requires a use of a computer program.\nMy program IRR-Versus-NPV will be of a value to ACCA’s students and also to both undergraduate and postgraduate students of Corporate Finance, Accounting, and Business studies.
