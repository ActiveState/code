Most of the web sites that work with user generated content use the text that was entered by the user as the url for this specific item and usually the user enter charates like ' '(space) '&', '.' and some other char that you want to remove or convert to _ , _and_ , _dot_. So i have wrote a dynamic code that you can setup what chars you what to change.
