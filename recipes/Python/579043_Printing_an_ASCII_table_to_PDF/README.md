This recipe shows how to print part of an ASCII table to PDF. It shows it for the first 32 ASCII characters, the control characters, i.e. the characters with ASCII codes 0 to 31. The same logic can be extended to print the remaining ASCII characters, either upto code 127 or 255, depending on your definition of ASCII, and also on whether your PDF font supports printing all those characters.\n
