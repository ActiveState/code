A small program utilizing the `ctypes` and `turtle` modules. You can *drive* the little turtle by turning your Thinkpad (which must have APS).\n\n*Requirements:*\n\nYou need a newer Thinkpad (T41, T42, T43, T6x, R5x, R6x or any newer) and need to have the Active Protection System drivers (now called Lenovo Airbag Protection) installed.\n
