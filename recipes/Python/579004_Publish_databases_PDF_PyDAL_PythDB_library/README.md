This recipe shows how to use the PyDAL database library for Python, together with xtopdf, a PDF creation library for Python, to publish database data to PDF. PyDAL was earlier a part of the web2py Python web framework, and then was split out into a separate library that does not need to be used with web2py. It supports access to many popular relational databases, both open source and proprietary.\n
