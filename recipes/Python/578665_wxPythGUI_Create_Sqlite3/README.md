A GUI built around wxPython in a way that will allow you to add to this application other forms and functionalities. The main DialogBox is to create,in a fast way, Sqlite3 databases that are used for web or applications development. In order to work properly, save the script in a separate directory.There is also more; each time you create a database a text file named "CreationLog.txt" will be created (for the first time you use the application or if it is not there) and updated, describing when and where was your database created and with what SQL query. I am pleased to receive all the suggestions and improvements on this site or to my e-mail directly if this is convenient to you.
