List the summed size of a directory (or set of directories) without the GUI.  This recipe makes it quick and easy to see where all your disk space has gone!  It has been tested under Windows and Unix, however it will probably be most useful under Windows considering the fact that Unix ships with a similar command, du.\n\nHave fun!
