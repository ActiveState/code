This recipe allows you to declare properties as inner classes.  It's based combining a class-based idea proposed by Michael Urman on python-dev (http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-October/057372.html) with late-binding properties (http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/408713)
