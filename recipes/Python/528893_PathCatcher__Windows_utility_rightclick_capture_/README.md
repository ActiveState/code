PathCatcher is a Windows utility that allows one to right-click on a file or a folder or a group of files and folders in Explorer and save its path to the clipboard.\n\nTo install, save the code as PathCatcher.py, then double-click the PathCatcher.py file. Afterwards, PathCatcher will appear in the Explorer right-click menu.
