Imagine if the *nix utilities 'dd', 'wget', and 'pv' had a baby. That baby would be named 'padd'. A 'dd' replacement (most commonly used options translate with no problem), that gives progress output like 'pv' and supports (currently) http(s) and ftp input sources, with more planned (sftp for one). Output support for ftp, sftp, and http(s) is also planned.
