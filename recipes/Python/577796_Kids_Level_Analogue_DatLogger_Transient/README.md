This code is kids level Analogue Data-Logger(/Transient-Recorder), using the Arduino series of dev' boards.\n\nIt is no where near completion and is a second feeder/feeler upload only.\n\nIt is designed to work from Classic Text Mode Python from Versions 1.4.0 to 2.7.2 on a Classic AMIGA, WinUAE, Linux and Windows, (32 bit), to Vista.\nNot tested on Python for Windows 7, (32 bit), nor Mac OSX flavours as I don't have these OSes.\n\nLinux versions run from a default root terminal for the time being.\n\nThe Arduino dev' board IS catered for in the code for the above platforms just thoroughly read the code for more information. It defaults to a DEMO mode so you can see it working...\n\nThe test code for the Arduino Diecimila Dev Board is here:-\n\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/577625-arduino-diecimila-board-access-inside-winuae-demo/\n\nEnjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)\n\nBazza, G0LCU...
