This is a small implementation of a stopwatch widget in Tkinter. The widget displays a label with minutes:seconds:1/100-seconds. The label is updated every 50 ms, but that can easily be changed. Methods are availble for starting, stopping and resetting the stopwatch. A simple program demonstrates the widget.
