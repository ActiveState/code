Instead of using two colors for active background and normal background, I use only one color and opacity parameter.\n\nI trigger the feeling of a button using different colors when the mouse is and isn't over. Many modern HTML search boxes uses the same approach.\n\nCommand function receives text of entry box when button is pressed.
