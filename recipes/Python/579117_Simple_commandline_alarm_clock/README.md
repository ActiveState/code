This recipe shows how to create a simple alarm clock in Python, that can be run from the command line in a terminal. It lets you specify the alarm time in minutes as a command line argument, and prints a wake-up message and beeps a few times, after that time arrives. You can use 0 for the minutes to test it immediately, including to adjust the volume using your speaker controls.\n
