Compression, encryption, and data codecs are all related fields that most programmers will use ready-made solutions for. This recipe is a shallow adventure into the writing of original code and algorithms that explores a combination of those topics. Based on the work of recipe 502202, the code here is compliant with Python 3.1 and will run a test of itself when executed. From the program's report, one can gather that the novel procedures compress the source and accurately decompress it again. For those who wish to experiment further with the concept, note that fewer unique characters will yield higher compression ratios.
