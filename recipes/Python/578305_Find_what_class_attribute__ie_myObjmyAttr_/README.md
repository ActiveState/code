When inspecting new code (or when debugging), it can be handy to know exactly where a given attribute on an object or class comes from.\n\nAs a simple example, if you have a class MyClass, you might want to know where MyClass().myMethod is defined.\n\nHowever, things can get tricky when things like __getattr__, __getattribute__, or even compiled objects come into play.  That's where this function comes in.  It returns what class a given attribute comes from, and what method was used to define it - ie, '__dict__' ('normal' definitions), '__slots__', '__getattr__', '__getattribute__', '(BUILTIN)'.\n\n(Note - this function should't be relied on to be 100% accurate - rather, it's a best guess, for where to look to find it.  It takes some pretty infrequent edge cases for it to be wrong, though...)
