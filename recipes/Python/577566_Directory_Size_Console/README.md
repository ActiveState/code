Have you ever wanted to find out how much room a particular directory was taking up on your hard drive? A roommate of mine in college was having trouble keeping track of where his hard drive space is going, so the following program provided a solution that allows a brief overview of a directory's size along with all of its children. A tree view is printed out in ASCII characters showing the relationship of each directory along with its size in a format easily readable to humans. The output can always be redirected to a text file if it needs to be saved for viewing later on.
