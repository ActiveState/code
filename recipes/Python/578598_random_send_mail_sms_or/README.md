If you need to do something irregularly, randomly during the day, you\noften forget. This script gives you mail, sms or popup window indefinitely in\nrandom interval to remind you of doing it. It runs forever. If you want to\nsend emails, uncomment the row sendMail() and fill variable me, to, smtp,\nname, login in function sendMail().
