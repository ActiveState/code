Uses an array to store the values, expands the size of the prime list on the fly, you can make a guess at how many you will need.\nI am finding it useful for the problems at http://projecteuler.net\nAny thoughts for improvement appreciated (I am going to try and neaten it up with a few list comprehensions and possibly speed up the initial array creation)
