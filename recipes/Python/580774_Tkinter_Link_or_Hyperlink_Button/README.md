If a background is not provided, the widget gets the background color from its container. The link button has two states: normal and visited. When the link is clicked, the state change to visited. When the link is clicked the action command is called. By default the text of the link has an underline. There is several options for customization.\n\nI also added this megawidget to my "Metro UI Tkinter" recipe:\n\nhttps://code.activestate.com/recipes/580729-metro-ui-tkinter
