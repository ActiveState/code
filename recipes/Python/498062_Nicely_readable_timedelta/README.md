You want to use nicely formatted timedeltas as an alternative to using absolute dates. Instead of writing "Last modified 2006-07-01" you want that to read "Modified two months ago" Or you are working for a credit card company and you want to send threatening letters; "Dear sir or madam, two weeks ago we contacted you about your overdue credit..."
