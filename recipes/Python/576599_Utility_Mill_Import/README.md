After looking at featurelist.org and noticing that someone wanted to import code stored on Utility Mill, the following code was written as an extension of previous work on automated testing. The original thread can be found at http://featurelist.org/features/details/238 . The code imported by the test at the end of this code can be found at http://utilitymill.com/edit/SPICE/27 & http://utilitymill.com/edit/nysiis/20 . Please note that this is Python 3.0 code importing Python 2.5 code and may not be useful in all contexts that you may wish to use it in. Also, modules stored on Utility Mill may need unconditionally executing code removed first before importing.
