For some people, thunderbird lacks of a powerfull automatic detach function that keeps the link to the detached file from the mail itself (like Eudora has).\nSome plugins exists but there is now way to detach a document and replace it with a link to it's new location.\nFor security reasons, the developper team doesn't want to allow the opening of a local file from thunderbird.\nWhen you have to keep large history of your emails, this may become a real problem for the size of your box and the facilities to automate some tasks on files (you can't use programs to see if you have doubles and so on).\nIf, like me, you want to keep your email box as slim as possible by detaching attached documents and keep links to the detached files, this may be for you.\n\nThe trick is that the file is detached and replaced by an html one in which you'll find the link to the file. The html file will be opened in your browser where the link to your local filesystem will operate.\n
