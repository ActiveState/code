The "code" in this recipe is a step by step "root" shell command line procedure for testing whether a(n) USB
Arduino Dev Board is working or not. To get more recognisable characters displayed it is best to use a
potentiometer wired as one end to +5V, the other end to Gnd and thw wiper to ANALOG IN 0.
This has been tested on various Linux Distros and kept as simple as possible so that anyone can understand it.

Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems... ;o)
