Managing ref-counting is a complex and error prone business. If you choose C++ to extend or embed Python, you can simply use a modification on `std::auto_ptr`. Instead of calling delete on the managed pointer, it will decref it.\n\nSo now you can do:\n\n    auto_pyptr pyHelloStr(PyStr_FromString("Hello World!"));\n\nand forget about having to decref it altogether! Just like `auto_ptr` you can get the `PyObject *` with `get()`, release it from managed control with `release()`, and rebind it with `reset(new_ptr)`. You can also incref it by calling `inc()`, but be cautious as you can easily create a leak by increfing once to much.
