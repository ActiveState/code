This recipe is the JavaScript client side of an overall recipe that shows how to do system monitoring using WebSockets, Python, Go (using websocketd), and JavaScript + HTML. The server side of the recipe (in Python, and using websocketd which is written in Go), is here:\n\nhttp://code.activestate.com/recipes/578803-using-websocketd-with-python-for-web-based-system-/?in=user-4173351\n\nThe system monitoring example shows the system disk space info (total, used and free) using the Python psutil module.\n
