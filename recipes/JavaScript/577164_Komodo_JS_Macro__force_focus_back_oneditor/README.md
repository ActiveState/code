A [Komodo](http://www.activestate.com/komodo) JavaScript macro that can be used to force the focus back to the Komodo editor after switching between windows (i.e. after using Alt-Tab).\n\nThis macro only applies to Windows and Mac OS - where there is an application activated notification event available.\n\nTo use this macro - set the macro to trigger on the "On startup" event.\n
