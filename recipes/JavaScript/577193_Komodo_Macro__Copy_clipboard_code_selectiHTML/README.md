This macro makes easy to paste on documents (MS Office, Open Office, iWorks Pages) code snippets with syntax highlight and/or line numbers.\n\nThis macro copies the selected code text or whole document if no selection is present on clipboard in HTML format.\n\nOn OSX you need at least Komodo 6 because previous versions don't support data flavors
