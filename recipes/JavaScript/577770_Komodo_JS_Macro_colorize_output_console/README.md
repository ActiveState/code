It's possible to colorize any Scintilla based widget (the editor part) in Komodo using a color scheme. In Komodo there is the "Fonts and Color" preferences that get applied to all scintilla widgets, but you can manually change individual scintilla widgets as you wish.\n\nThis macro changes the color scheme of the Command Output tab to use the "Dark" scheme.\n
